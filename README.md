# Learn Lua!

This document contains ideas and lessons taught in a 10 week introductory programming course. Each class is 90 minutes.

The course is taught to various groups of students aged 11-13 and is taught with the assumption of basic computer skills (using a web browser, mouse, and keyboard). For most of the students, this is the first time they are doing any formal computer programming.
